#Basics of java: 

Java Source Code: This is the code written by developers in the Java programming language.

Java Compiler: This tool converts the Java source code into Java bytecode. The compiler checks the code for errors and then translates it into a platform-independent bytecode.

Java Bytecode: This is the intermediate representation of the Java code, which is platform-independent. This makes Java a portable language, as the same bytecode can run on any machine that has a JVM.

Java Virtual Machine (JVM): The JVM reads and executes the Java bytecode. It acts as an interpreter between the bytecode and the machine code of the operating system.

Operating System and Hardware: The JVM interacts with the operating system, which in turn communicates with the hardware to execute the program.
